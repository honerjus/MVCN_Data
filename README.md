# MVCN_Data
Network Generation Files are present within the .zip file
You need MATLAB downloaded to generate these networks
Networks can be generated by clicking basalt_Matlabcode, then click Networks to get into the correct folder
In the networks folder network_gen needs to be pulled up to generate files
  n is the sixe domain you want to generate
  r1 is the target radius of the network
  ntimes describes the number of times you want to update the voronoi centers
  iter_max describes the number of voronoi centers that the code will attempt to place in the domain
The example generated networks file shows an expected output file from this code
The folder called mega column code mapps highly transmissive mega column fractures onto the domain
Data analysis and Debug code files all provide extra scripts to look at generated networks
  They need t be in the same folder as the generated network
